* React Native
* Expo-CLI
* Context Hook

#### The app flow:
* The user sees a selection of dishes. He chooses a dish.
* Then he sees a list of side dishes. The user selects one.
* Then the user sees a selection of drinks. He chooses a drink.
* The user then sees a result page that says “Thank you for your order” and reprints all of the user selections.
* Lastly there needs to be a button to “new order” to start the ordering process from scratch.

#### Issues
* The app will duplicate dishes if added twice.
* Only tested on Androids

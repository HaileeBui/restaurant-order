Technical test

#### The app flow: 
The user sees a selection of dishes. He chooses a dish. 
Then he sees a list of side dishes. The user selects one. 
Then the user sees a selection of drinks. He chooses a drink. 
The user then sees a result page that says “Thank you for your order” and reprints all of the user selections. 
Lastly there needs to be a button to “new order” to start the ordering process from scratch. 


There should be different views for the different dishes & drinks, and the user should be able to select 1 or more of the choices on each page, and move on.
